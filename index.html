                    The items in this visualization are expressed by pie charts on the graph. It shows four attributes expressed through x and y position, as well as the size of the pie chart and the area of sectors. The marks here are areas which are used as items. The channels are position in both directions, color, and tilt and area of the pie charts.

                    The items here are expressed by the lines and the attributes are time and rank. The marks are lines that are used as the items. The channels used are position in both directions, color, and tilt.

                    The items are expressed by the mind map and more specifically the different topics stemming from the central concept. The marks are the lines that are used to connect the ideas that stem from the central topic to the central area. The channels are the colors and positioning of the separate ideas because the ideas stemming from the blue central topic are in red and are positioned surrounding it.

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    The items are expressed by a stacked bar chart and more specifically the separated stacked values in each bar. The mark is the area of the bar graph that is used to show a certain quantity for each value. The channels are the colors of the different squares that are stakced up, the poisitioning of the block on the bar graph, and the area of the box to show a certain quantity.
